# Crawler Certified Program

## Overview
The Crawler Certified program is an initiative designed to review, validate, and certify web crawler software to ensure ethical and responsible usage of digital content. By establishing industry standards for crawler software development and operation, this program aims to promote responsible data collection practices while respecting website owners' rights and user privacy.

## Program Objectives
- Establish clear standards for ethical web crawler development and operation
- Provide certification for compliant crawler software
- Improve trust between content creators and data collectors
- Reduce unethical data harvesting practices
- Promote transparency in web data collection

## Certification Process

### 1. Application
Organizations or developers submit their crawler software for certification, providing:
- Complete source code access
- Documentation of crawler behavior
- Current deployment practices
- Data retention and usage policies

### 2. Code Review
Our expert team conducts a thorough code review focusing on:
- Technical implementation
- Compliance with standards
- Security measures
- Ethical considerations

### 3. Operational Assessment
Evaluation of how the crawler operates in real-world scenarios:
- Load testing to ensure reasonable server impact
- Compliance verification with website policies
- Data collection transparency

### 4. Remediation
If issues are identified:
- Detailed report provided to applicant
- Guidance on necessary modifications
- Follow-up review of implemented changes

### 5. Certification
Upon successful completion:
- Issuance of Crawler Certified badge
- Public listing in certified crawler directory
- Annual re-certification requirements

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementation of appropriate request throttling
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Strict adherence to robots exclusion protocol
- **Conditional GET Requests**: Use of HTTP headers like ETag and If-Modified-Since
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of HTTP errors with appropriate backoff strategies
- **IP Rotation Policies**: Transparent and appropriate use of multiple IPs (if applicable)

### Ethical Requirements
- **Data Collection Transparency**: Clear documentation on what data is collected and why
- **Content Attribution**: Proper attribution mechanisms for collected content
- **Privacy Protection**: Measures to filter or anonymize personally identifiable information
- **Opt-out Mechanisms**: Support for site-specific opt-out from crawling
- **Minimal Footprint**: Efficient crawling that minimizes server load and environmental impact

### Legal Compliance
- **Terms of Service**: Respect for websites' terms of service
- **Copyright Respect**: Mechanisms to respect copyright and intellectual property rights
- **Regional Compliance**: Adherence to relevant jurisdictional data protection laws
- **Fair Use Assessment**: Evaluation of data usage against fair use principles

## Developer Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Implement polite crawling with adequate delays between requests
- Clearly identify your crawler with appropriate user-agent strings
- Maintain up-to-date documentation on crawler behavior
- Establish clear data retention and usage policies
- Provide contact information for website owners to report issues
- Implement monitoring systems to detect and prevent abusive patterns

### Implementation Resources
- Open-source reference implementations
- Code libraries for ethical crawling
- Testing tools for crawler behavior assessment
- Documentation templates for transparency requirements

## Benefits of Certification

### For Crawler Operators
- Public recognition of ethical practices
- Improved relationships with content providers
- Reduced legal and reputation risks
- Framework for responsible data collection

### For Website Owners
- Increased trust in certified crawlers
- Reduced server load from unethical crawling
- Greater visibility into data collection purposes
- Access to dispute resolution process

### For the Broader Web Ecosystem
- Promotion of ethical data collection standards
- Reduction in aggressive crawling practices
- Balanced approach to information access and rights protection
- Transparency in how web data is collected and used

## Program Governance

### Oversight Committee
The Crawler Certified program is governed by a diverse committee representing:
- Web technology experts
- Legal specialists in digital rights
- Content creator representatives
- Data ethics researchers
- Industry practitioners

### Annual Review Process
The program criteria undergo annual review to:
- Address emerging technologies and practices
- Respond to regulatory changes
- Incorporate community feedback
- Evolve with changing web ecosystems

## Getting Started
Organizations interested in having their crawler software certified can begin the process by submitting their project to this github repository as an issue.
